[MESSAGES CONTROL]

disable=bad-continuation, fixme, len-as-condition, inherit-non-class, invalid-name, missing-docstring, no-else-return, no-method-argument, no-self-argument, no-self-use, protected-access, too-many-function-args, trailing-whitespace, unnecessary-lambda, unused-argument
# Rationales:
#   bad-continuation: Aligned indentation is bad for maintenance and version control
#   fixme: "Yes, yes, I know! That's why I put it there!"
#   inherit-non-class: false positives on interface declarations
#   invalid-name: TODO turn this one back on
#   len-as-condition: I prefer the extra type-checking and documentation resulting from using len
#   missing-docstring: not everything needs documentation. TODO try setting the limit high
#   no-else-return: it rejects "if x return y else return z" which is silly
#   no-method-argument: false positives on interface declarations
#   no-self-argument: false positives on interface declarations
#   no-self-use: Doesn't understand that polymorphism means methods
#   protected-access: because I am using it for 'friend' access, maybe fix that
#   too-many-function-args: false positives on interface usage (note that this is not "more args than style limit" this is "more args at call than parameters at declaration")
#   trailing-whitespace: indenting blank lines is more sensible than the opposite, and trailing whitespace is mostly not worth the trouble to keep neat anyway
#   unnecessary-lambda: false positives (complains about passing functions that happens to be constant)
#   unused-argument: apparently cannot be prevented when an implementation legitimately does not use an arg
